# Start Learning Go (Golang)

Welcome to my **Learning Go** repository! This is a personal project where I document my journey as I learn the Go programming language. Here, you will find all the files, code snippets, and projects that I create while exploring Go.

## About Go

Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language designed for simplicity and efficiency. It is known for its strong performance, easy concurrency, and robust standard library, making it a great choice for building scalable applications.

## Repository Structure

In this repository, you will find:

- **Code Examples**: Simple programs and snippets that demonstrate various Go concepts and features.
- **Projects**: More complex applications that I build as I learn and apply my knowledge.
- **Notes**: Personal notes and resources that I find helpful during my learning process.

## Learning Goals

As I work through this repository, my goals include:

- Understanding the fundamentals of Go, including syntax, data types, and control structures.
- Exploring Go's unique features, such as goroutines and channels for concurrency.
- Building practical applications to reinforce my learning and showcase my skills.
